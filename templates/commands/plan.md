## Outline

### a. CREATION MODE

If no existing implementation plan file is found at the IMPL_PLAN path, you are in creation mode. Execute the plan template to generate all required design artifacts from scratch.

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

### b. UPDATE MODE (spec changes)

Consider this rules if the feature specification already exists and IMPL_PLAN is present

1. **IMPORTANT**: In update mode, DO NOT run `{SCRIPT}`, as this will overwrite existing files. Instead, assume the environment is already set up.

2. **Load context**: Parse the spec diff (if accessible) or re-read entire FEATURE_SPEC.

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Update the Technical Context section to reflect new requirements, constraints, or unknowns from the updated spec (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Update Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Re-scan Technical Context for any remaining NEEDS CLARIFICATION introduced by changes.
   - Phase 0: Update research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Update data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design
   - Re-check if Technical Context is updated for new requirements/unknowns
   - Stop if unresolved merge conflicts or accidental template overwrite

5. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `{AGENT_SCRIPT}`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications
